# 05-Space-SHMUP
 For this extended version of SpaceSHMUP Plus, I added a few things to it.
 1. The first thing is a new enemy called Enemy_5, it is supposed to be a 'boss' type of enemy that spawns at the very start of the level. Its health and speed are increased to make it more difficult. It also gives 300 points instead of 100 when destroyed.
2. The next implementation is the score count and high score count located at the top corners of the screen.
3. The last element that I put is a start menu, which contains the game's title in purple and a 'Start Game' button that turns into a pinkish color when the mouse is hovered over it. When the button is pressed, it loads the game!
